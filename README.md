Traffic Light with ATTiny13

Here you can download the Sketch(ampel.ino) for your own Traffic Light based on a ATTiny13.
The red/yellow/green LEDs connected to PB3/PB4/PB2.
With PB0 you can change the state. If PB0 is High the Lights change from red to red/yellow to green. If PB0 is Low the Lights change from green to yellow to red. 

Open the Sketch in Arduino and then upload on the ATTiny13.
For upload to ATTiny13 you need this package: https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore
